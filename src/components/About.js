      <p>
        Hi, I’m [Your Name], a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a deep love for building web applications.
        I specialize in React, JavaScript, and have experience working with back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
        My journey into development started [years ago], and since then I’ve been constantly learning and growing as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving complex problems and building scalable applications. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me [doing a hobby].
